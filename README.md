# üèÜ Spitch AI Speech Analytics Dashboard

## üöÄ Overview
**Spitch AI Speech Analytics Dashboard** is a practical demo project tailored for Spitch AI. It processes call audio data to provide actionable insights through:

- **Accurate Transcription:** Converts uploaded audio files into text.
- **Extractive Summarization:** Uses a controlled TextRank algorithm to extract key sentences directly from the transcription.
- **Sentiment Analysis & Entity Extraction:** Analyzes sentiment and extracts keywords and named entities to offer a quick overview of call dynamics.

This project demonstrates end-to-end capabilities‚Äîfrom speech-to-text conversion to insightful data extraction‚Äîusing state-of-the-art NLP techniques.

## üìå How It Works
1. **Audio Processing:**  
   - Upload an audio file via the Streamlit dashboard.
   - The file is transcribed into text using a speech-to-text engine.

2. **Data Enrichment:**  
   - **Punctuation Restoration:** The raw transcription is enhanced to improve readability.
   - **NLP Analysis:** Extracts keywords, performs sentiment analysis, and identifies named entities.

3. **Extractive Summarization:**  
   - Applies TextRank (via Sumy) to select key sentences from the restored transcription.
   - Generates a concise summary that faithfully reflects the call's content.

4. **Interactive Insights:**  
   - The dashboard displays transcription, key insights (keywords, sentiment, entities), and the extractive summary in real time.
